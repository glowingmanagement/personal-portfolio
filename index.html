                    <h5 class="experience-heading">April 2022 - Present</h5>
                    <p>
                        My role focuses on the technical and creative aspect of events and productions, working creatively with production managers/directors to reach outstanding technical designs with both lighting and sound design. I designed and operated various major productions which have all been successful. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Additionally, on top of the theatre productions, the site also holds regular conferences, school events and concerts across 8 venues. I have learnt to be very versatile to be able to meet all of the requirements that people need for their events.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the bigger productions, we also encourage students to get involved with the technical side of the show. I program the sound and lighting with the students shadowing, and then I teach them how to operate the show and key skills in ensuring we run a consistent show each night.

                    <p>
                        I acted as the technical manager throughout the recruitment process of the position. This role built upon my current assistant role and allowed me to take on additional responsibilities to ensure the site remained fully functioning.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The additional duties mainly involved collating information for upcoming events and making sure tasks were prioritised to ensure every event ran smoothly and to a high standard. This was particularly challenging without any additional technicians on site, and with school lessons limiting the set up time for major events.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All events and requests were completed to a high standard throughout my time with these additional responsibilities.

                    <p>
                        After starting with the Palace Drum Clinic to run small aspects of digital marketing, the pandemic very quickly put a halt to all of our live events. My role then became crucial to the growth of the business. I took the lead on digital marketing and while working with many professional drummers, we successfully grew the page engagement from less and 100 per month to over 10k per month.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As the business grew, my role now oversees the operational side of the business and also assist in the general business development to ensure we continue to grow.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To keep up with competitors, I self-taught React Native and have coded and developed an app from scratch. This app is currently in Beta testing with the aim to role it out to the public in Spring 2022.

                    <p>
                        Rubato Records was a project I set up throughout the pandemic. The aim was to educate and showcase upcoming artists throughout a very challenging period.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I ran weekly livestreams where I would interview independent artists to see what they were doing throughout lockdown. I also contacted industry professionals to run masterclass sessions. I received support from many professionals including, Danny O’Donoghue from The Script. He was very supportive of the business and said, “I know [Josh] is going to be a mover and a shaker in the industry because he's very proactive”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also worked with 2 international artists and we were able to offer recording packages for artists who couldn’t record from home. We would record instruments in our own home studios and create a product that the artists could release and still build their brand throughout this time.

                    <p>
                        In university, I started Glowing Management as a way to put into practice the skills I was learning throughout university. Throughout the degree, I built up a roster of 5 artists as well as providing support and advice for many other local acts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I would plan and carry out release campaigns on a very limited budget. To achieve this I had to learn many new skills such as photo and video editing to ensure the campaigns were successful and within budget.

                    <p>
                        I am a very hard-working and self-motivated individual who is keen to continue to learn and develop new skills.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Working in the events industry has provided some great experiences, but I’m now looking for a new challenge in a career that is both sustainable and challenging while providing more opportunities for growth and development.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have spent time developing transferable skills including, communication, time management, organisation and many more. The key transferable skill is the ability to troubleshoot calmly and efficiently. Occasionally things go wrong during a show or production (especially when working with young students) and it’s crucial to be able to quickly get things back on track without anyone noticing.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Key Skills</h3>

                    <h3>Interests & Hobbies</h3>
                    <p>
                        I love having opportunities to challenge myself and be creative. I have been playing drums for over 10 years, and more recently picked up guitar and vocals. Since then I have been writing, recording and releasing my own music.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since starting this project in March 2021, I have released a few singles, played festivals and gigs, received support from the likes of BBC Introducing, and gained almost 80k streams on Spotify.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also enjoy keeping active, and play sports like tennis, squash, climbing and more recently, I’ve done my diving PADI which I want to explore more opportunities through that.
